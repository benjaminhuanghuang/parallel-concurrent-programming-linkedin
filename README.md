## Key points
- Process and thread
- Mutual exclusion
  - Race condition
- Lock
  - Reentrant lock
  - Try lock
  - Read-write lock
- Liveness
  - Dead lock
  - Starvation
  - Live lock

## Setup
```
$ python3 -m venv venv3

$ . venv3/bin/activate

(venv3)$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

...
(venv3)$ deactivate
```


## Global interperater lock
Mechamism limits python to only execute ONE thread at a time

CPython has GIL

GIL is not a bottleneck for I/O bound application

CIL can negatively impact performance for CPU bound application

Use the python multiprocessing package to implement parallel operation with multiple process instead of multiple threads.
